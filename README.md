## Abstruct
We demonstrate experimental results with LLMs that address robotics action planning problems. Recently, LLMs have been applied in robotics action planning, particularly using a code generation approach that converts complex high-level instructions into mid-level policy codes. In contrast, our approach acquires text descriptions of the task and scene objects, then formulates action planning through natural language reasoning, and outputs coordinate level control commands, thus reducing the necessity for intermediate representation code as policies. Our approach is evaluated on a multi-modal prompt simulation benchmark, demonstrating that our prompt engineering experiments with natural language reasoning significantly enhance success rates compared to its absence. Furthermore, our approach illustrates the potential for natural language descriptions to transfer robotics skills from known tasks to previously unseen tasks.
